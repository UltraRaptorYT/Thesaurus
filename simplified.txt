A  stray  cat  was  recently  spotted  in  the  neighborhood protecting her little cat as the two were being attacked by a ferocious dog. The brave cat eventually managed to chase  the  ferocious  dog  away.  This  goes  to  show  that  we should  never  underestimate  a  cat's  maternal  instincts when looking after her little cat.
